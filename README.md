# Here.news - Whole News Experience (HN2)

## Introduction

Here.news leverages advanced AI and decentralized technologies to revolutionize journalism, ensuring accurate, unbiased, and comprehensive news coverage while actively engaging communities and professionals. Here.news aims to bridge the gap between traditional journalism and emerging AI capabilities to provide a trusted source of information and foster democratic narratives in the digital age.

## Vision & Protocol

Here.news v2 (HN2) provides a whole news experience (WNE) allowing users to consume content from different sources (media outlets, organizations, individual contributions) and mark, adopt (access and save), appreciate (tip), trade (long/short), and share content. This forms a content marketplace that predicts the best content based on personal judgments and crowd intelligence.

### Core Protocol Features

#### Content Discovery & Consumption
- Aggregation from diverse sources (traditional media, organizations, individual creators)
- Personalized feeds based on interests, trusted sources, and community signals
- Rich media experiences with contextual information

#### Content Curation
- Mark, save, and organize content in personal collections
- Annotate and add context to stories
- Create curated content bundles for specific topics or perspectives

#### Content Ownership
- Tokenized content shares representing partial ownership of stories/articles
- Initial content offerings (ICOs) for new stories or investigations
- Content creators receive baseline revenue from initial ownership distribution

#### Content Trading
- Buy/sell content shares as value perception changes
- Long/short positions on content relevance and staying power
- Yield generation from holding shares of valuable, evergreen content
- Price discovery mechanism reflecting collective intelligence

#### Content Appreciation
- Micropayments and tips directly to creators
- Reputation building for consistent quality contributions
- Community rewards for early discovery of valuable content

## Current Features

- **Evolutional Stories**: Follow all kinds of events in the world in different languages, curated by AI but from unbiased media articles, user comments, and neutral language moderators.
- **Engagement with Spices**: Users can upvote, downvote, and reply to each event with credit (called "spice"). Replies and interactions are dynamically displayed. Spices can be deposited and withdrawn from the user's account via both fiat and bitcoin (LN) gateways.
- **Deeper Discussions**: Indicate deeper discussion threads with specific icons and provide links to extended comment threads.
